* Why ZEST?

ZEST is aimed to provide a lightweight and high-performance RESTful framework that enables MVC and REST for Web applications.

ZEST is also designed to work seamlessly with [http://www.zkoss.org ZK].

* Why not [http://struts.apache.org/ Struts]?

The MVC concept of ZEST is inspired from Struts. However, Struts is too complex. Many features are useless when working with a modern framework, such as [http://www.zkoss.org ZK].

* Is ZEST suggested for ZK applications?

With ZEST, you could provide an additional REST or MVC layer on top of ZK, such that URL will be logic names (e.g., `http://foo.com/accounts/list`) rather than ZUML files (e.g., `http://foo.com/accounts/list.zul`).

On the hand, you don't need ZEST if you prefer to work on ZUML files directly.

* Does ZEST require ZK?

No, it works with any Web framework. However, it requires two jar files from ZK, zcommon.jar and zweb.jar.
